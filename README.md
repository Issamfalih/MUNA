MUNA: a MUltiplex Network Analysis library that I've developed in R on top of igraph network analysis package. In its current version, MUNA provides primitives to build, edit and modify multiplex networks. It also provides a bunch of functions that allow to provide basic metrics about multiplex networks. However, the most interesting functionality provided by MUNA is probably the wide variety of available community detection algorithms. Actually, the library implements different approaches for community detection including: partition aggregation approaches, layer aggregation approaches and direct multiplex approaches such as the MuxLicod algorithm. It also offer an extended list of multiplex community evaluation indexes.

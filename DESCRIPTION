Description: MUNA: a MUltiplex Network Analysis library that we have developed
    on top of igraph network analysis package. In its current version, MUNA provides
    primitives to build, edit and modify multiplex networks. It also provides a
    bunch of functions computing basic metrics on multiplex networks. However, the
    most interesting functionality provided by MUNA is probably the wide variety
    of available community detection algorithms. Actually, the library implements
    different approaches for community detection including: partition aggregation
    approaches, layer aggregation approaches and direct multiplex approaches such
    as the Genlouvain and Muxlicod algorithms. It also offers an extended list of
    multiplex community evaluation indexes.
